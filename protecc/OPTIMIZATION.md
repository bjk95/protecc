# Model Optimization Guide for Spam Classifier

This guide covers advanced techniques to optimize the Qwen2-0.5B spam classification model for size, memory usage, and efficiency.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. LoRA Hyperparameter Optimization

In `optimize_model.py`, we've implemented a more efficient LoRA configuration:

- **Reduced rank (r)**: Changed from 16 to 4 (75% reduction in adapter size)
- **Reduced target modules**: Only using `q_proj` and `v_proj` instead of all attention modules
- **Reduced lora_alpha**: From 32 to 16

These changes significantly decrease the adapter size while maintaining most of the model's performance.

### 2. Sequence Length Reduction

- Decreased max token length from 128 to 64 tokens
- SMS messages are typically short, so this reduces memory usage and computation
- You'll see this reflected in all scripts where `max_length=64`

### 3. Weight Pruning

The optimization script applies magnitude-based pruning:

- Small weights below a threshold are zeroed out
- This introduces sparsity, making the model more compressible
- Helps with both on-disk size and memory usage

### 4. Dynamic Quantization

- Applies INT8 quantization to linear layers post-training
- Reduces model size and memory footprint by ~75%
- Minimal impact on accuracy for this classification task

### 5. CoreML / ONNX Export

The `export_coreml.py` script provides:

- Model wrapper to fix the CoreML export issue with DynamicCache
- ONNX export as a fallback method
- FP16 precision to reduce size on Apple devices

## How to Use the Optimization Scripts

### Step 1: Optimize the Model

Run the optimization script to create a smaller, more efficient model:

```bash
python optimize_model.py
```

This will:
1. Load your trained model
2. Apply pruning and quantization
3. Save the optimized model to `./qwen2-0.5b-sms-spam-optimized`

### Step 2: Export for Mobile/Edge Deployment

To convert the model for mobile deployment:

```bash
python export_coreml.py
```

This will create:
- A CoreML model for Apple devices
- An ONNX model as fallback if CoreML fails

### Step 3: Run Inference Benchmarks

Test the optimized model's performance:

```bash
# Run on single text
python inference.py --text "Your message here" --model_path ./qwen2-0.5b-sms-spam-optimized

# Run benchmark on sample texts
python inference.py --benchmark --model_path ./qwen2-0.5b-sms-spam-optimized

# Run on GPU if available
python inference.py --benchmark --device cuda
```

## Performance Comparison

| Optimization              | Size Reduction | Speed Improvement | Memory Usage  |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Original QLoRA (r=16)     | Baseline       | Baseline          | Baseline      |
| Reduced LoRA (r=4)        | ~75%           | ~5-10%            | ~10-15% less  |
| Max Length 64             | Minimal        | ~30-40%           | ~40-50% less  |
| Weight Pruning            | ~30-40%        | Minimal           | ~10-20% less  |
| INT8 Quantization         | ~75%           | Varies by device  | ~70-75% less  |
| ONNX Runtime Optimization | Minimal        | ~20-50%           | Minimal       |

## Additional Optimization Ideas

1. **Distillation**: Create a tiny student model trained on the predictions of your tuned model
2. **KNN-based pruning**: More sophisticated pruning that better preserves important connections
3. **MobileNet-style factorization**: Factor linear layers into separable components
4. **Model merging**: Merge multiple small specialized models for specific spam types
5. **Activation caching**: Cache attention activations between common prefixes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter CoreML export issues, try:

1. Using the ONNX path (often more reliable)
2. Reducing sequence length further
3. Applying torch.jit.script instead of trace
4. Using the newer torch.export() API if available

For quantization issues:
1. Try different bit-widths (2-bit, 4-bit)
2. Explore alternate quantization schemes (like AWQ or GPTQ)
3. Apply quantization-aware fine-tuning
